# workoutGenerator
basic workout generator if you're too lazy to write your own

For intermediate - advanced weightlifting; there are no tutorials or the like involved.

Give your workout preferences:
- What is your split? (upper/lower, pull/push/legs, etc.)
- What do you want to work? (pull day, leg day, etc.)
- Any emphases? (small calves, more biceps, etc., or none)
- How long do you want your workout?
- What are your workout goals? (Tone, build mass, strength training, etc.)

It will spit out a workout for you. Boom. Easy. Done.

# What's different about this?
Actual, realistic workouts. No "1x35 bench press" bs. Easy to use.
